# Task #2 Instructions

## Language: Python

1. Download the archive from the provided link.
2. Calculate the SHA3-256 hash for each file in the archive.
3. Write hashes as 64 hex digits in lowercase.
4. Sort the hashes in ascending order.
5. Join sorted hashes without any separator.
6. Concatenate the resulted string with your email address in lowercase.
7. Find the SHA3-256 hash of the resulting string.
8. Send the obtained 64 hex digits in lowercase to the Discord channel.

## Submission Command

# Checking for an Odd Number of Unique Moves in Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Language: JavaScript

1. Run the script providing an odd number of unique moves in rock-paper-scissors.
2. Example script execution:

```bash
node rockPaperScissors.js rock paper scissors
```

**Note:** Ensure that an odd number of unique moves is provided before running the script.

## Additional Hints

- Ensure you use the SHA3-256 algorithm.
- Process exactly 256 files from the archive.
- Concatenate strings without separators.
- Write the email in lowercase and append it to the end of the result string.
- Calculate a separate hash for each file.

## Task1: Longest Common Substring

### Problem Statement

Write a JavaScript code that prints the longest common substring of passed arguments. The code will be running under Node.js, and arguments will be passed via the command line. If the longest common substring is empty (no arguments are passed or arguments have no common substrings), print a single newline. If there are several solutions, print any single one of them.

### Limits

- Single string length: ≤ 256
- Number of strings: ≤ 64
- Strings contain only English letters and digits
- Time limit per test: 5 seconds

### Requirements

- Output should not contain any excess characters (error or debug messages, additional newlines, etc.).
- The solution is accepted if all tests are passed.
- Result is calculated based on JavaScript file size (the smaller the better). So, no comments, no long names, no indents, etc.
- You cannot use any external packages or imports.
- You cannot access "external world", e.g., read files, open network connections, etc.
- Your solution should be in the lcs.js file.
- You have to use only command-line arguments (no readline, no process.stdin, etc.; ONLY process.argv).
- When called without arguments, your script should not fail.
- If any test is failed, your grade for this task is zero.

**Task #1 (ALL GROUPS)**

**How to submit task #1:**
You have to drag and drop a script with the solution into the #task1 channel. And type (in the same message, not a separate one) the following line:

**You have to use the email specified during course enrollment.**

Submitted solutions are checked by a script, do not add descriptions or instructions.

If something went wrong, just describe the situation via email to p.lebedev@itransition.com.
